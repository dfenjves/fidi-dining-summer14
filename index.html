				<h4 class="description">An oasis of excellent, delicious, and mostly healthy food in the bland, crappy lunch wasteland that is the Bowling Green/Battery Park neighborhood. I love these guys, and my whole office is hooked on their falafel as well as their kale salad.

				<h4 class="description">I come to Pret basically all the time for lunch because the food is awesome and there is never a long line or wait to check out.  Not to mention- the staff there are pure rock stars!  Just the friendliest people ever, especially Anthony.  They take their jobs seriously and are a pleasure to do business with.

				<h4 class="description">I am pretty sure I have shortened my lifespan by several years because of how frequently I ate here when I worked in the area. Seriously great lunch place. I haven't had anything bad here, but my favorite was the pork sandwich with fried plantains and that mysterious and delicious green sauce. Good prices too.

				Seriously. Must eat grub. Skip the shrimp and crab rolls. Double down on the lobster roll. The Maine craft beers and soft drinks are excellent as well.
